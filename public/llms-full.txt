# Fathom AI MCP Server - Complete Documentation

> A remote MCP server that connects AI assistants like Claude to Fathom AI meetings, transcripts, and AI summaries.

This is the full documentation for LLMs and AI systems. For a shorter version, see /llms.txt

  "items": [
    {
      "title": string,
      "meeting_title": string | null,

      "calendar_invitees_domains_type": "only_internal" | "one_or_more_external",
      "transcript_language": string,
      "calendar_invitees": [
        {
          "name": string | null,
          "email": string | null,
          "email_domain": string | null,

        "team": string | null
      },

      "default_summary": {...} | null,
      "action_items": [...] | null,
      "crm_matches": {...} | null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Usage:**

```
User: "Show me my meetings from last week"
Tool call: list_meetings with created_after="2026-01-27T00:00:00Z", created_before="2026-02-03T23:59:59Z"
```

---

### 2. search_meetings

Search meetings by title. This is an MCP-native tool that performs client-side filtering since Fathom's API doesn't provide a search endpoint.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| query | string | Yes | Search term to match against meeting title |
| calendar_invitees_domains | string[] | No | Filter by attendee email domains |
| calendar_invitees_domains_type | enum | No | "all", "only_internal", or "one_or_more_external" |
| created_after | ISO datetime | No | Only meetings created after this date |
| created_before | ISO datetime | No | Only meetings created before this date |
| cursor | string | No | Pagination cursor |
| include_action_items | boolean | No | Include action items |
| include_crm_matches | boolean | No | Include CRM matches |
| recorded_by | string[] | No | Filter by recorder emails |
| teams | string[] | No | Filter by team names |

**Response Schema:**

Same as list_meetings, but filtered to only include meetings where the title or meeting_title contains the query string (case-insensitive).

**Performance Note:**

For users with many meetings, this tool fetches all meetings matching the filters then filters client-side. For better performance, use list_meetings with date filters instead.

**Example Usage:**

```
User: "Find meetings about the product roadmap"
Tool call: search_meetings with query="product roadmap"
```

      },
      "text": string,
      "timestamp": string
