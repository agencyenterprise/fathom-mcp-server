# Fathom MCP Server

> A remote MCP server that connects AI assistants like Claude to Fathom meetings, transcripts, and AI summaries.

## What is this?

Fathom MCP Server is an open source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables MCP hosts (like Claude Desktop) to access Fathom meeting data. It acts as a bridge between AI assistants and Fathom's meeting recording and transcription service.

Think of MCP as "USB-C for AI applications" — this server plugs Fathom's capabilities into any MCP-compatible AI assistant.
