# Fathom AI MCP Server

> A remote MCP server that connects AI assistants like Claude to Fathom AI meetings, transcripts, and AI summaries.

## What is this?

Fathom AI MCP Server is an open source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables MCP hosts (like Claude Desktop) to access Fathom AI meeting data. It acts as a secure bridge between AI assistants and Fathom AI's meeting recording and transcription service.

Think of MCP as "USB-C for AI applications" — this server plugs Fathom's capabilities into any MCP-compatible AI assistant.
